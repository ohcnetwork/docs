### Creating a New Project

1. **Navigate to Projects**: From the admin dashboard, access the "Projects" section.
2. **Initiate Project Creation**: Click on the "New Project" button or a similar option to start the creation process.
3. **Provide Project Details**: Fill in the essential project information:
   * **Title**: A concise and descriptive name for the project.
   * **Description (Optional)**: An overview of the project's purpose, scope, and intended use.
4. **Configure AI Settings**:
   * **Model**: Select the desired AI model for the project. Ayushma offers various models, each with its strengths and capabilities. Options may include GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and others.
   * **Prompt (Optional)**: Provide a prompt or set of instructions to guide the AI assistant's behavior and response style within the project's context.
5. **Preset Questions (Optional)**: Add a list of preset questions relevant to the project's domain. These questions will appear as suggestions for users to initiate conversations.
6. **Save Project**: Click the "Create" or "Save" button to finalize the project creation.

### Configuring Project Settings

* **Title and Description**: Admins can modify the project's title and description as needed.
* **AI Model**: The selected AI model can be changed to adjust the AI assistant's capabilities and performance.
* **Prompt**: Admins can refine the prompt to fine-tune the AI's behavior and response style.
* **Preset Questions**: The list of preset questions can be updated or expanded to offer users more starting points for conversations.
* **Default Project**: Admins can designate a project as the default project. Users will be directed to the default project upon initial login or when no specific project is selected.
* **Archived**: Projects can be archived to remove them from active use while retaining their data for future reference or analysis.

### Managing Documents

1. **Access Project Documents**: Navigate to the documents section within the selected project.
2. **Add Documents**: Click the "Add Document" button or a similar option.
3. **Choose Document Type**: Select the type of document you want to add, such as:
   * **File**: Upload a file from your local system. Supported formats might include PDF, TXT, and others.
   * **URL**: Provide a URL to a web page containing relevant information.
   * **Text**: Directly input text content.
4. **Provide Document Details**:
   * **Title**: Enter a title for the document.
   * **Description (Optional)**: Add a description for the document.
5. **Save Document**: Click the "Save" button to add the document to the project.

### Additional Insights

* **Speech-to-Text Engine**: Admins can choose the speech-to-text engine used for processing voice input within a project. Options may include OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, and potentially self-hosted solutions.
* **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Similar to the speech-to-text engine, admins can select the text-to-speech engine for generating audio output. Ayushma may offer options such as OpenAI and Google Text-to-Speech.
* **OpenAI API Key**: The code suggests that Ayushma might require an OpenAI API key for certain functionalities, such as accessing advanced AI models or using OpenAI's speech-to-text and text-to-speech services. Admins might need to manage these API keys and ensure their validity.

### Project Administration Benefits

* **Tailored AI Experiences**: Project administration allows admins to customize AI assistant experiences for different medical domains or use cases, optimizing performance and relevance for specific contexts.
* **Knowledge Management**: Admins can curate and maintain project-specific knowledge bases by adding and managing reference documents, ensuring the AI assistant has access to the most up-to-date and relevant information.
* **Control and Security**: Project administration tools enable admins to control access to projects, ensuring data security and privacy.
* **Performance Monitoring**: Admins can monitor project usage, analyze conversation history, and gather feedback to continually improve the AI assistant's performance and effectiveness.
