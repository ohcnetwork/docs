# CARE Contributor's Guide

## Introduction to CARE
CARE is an open-source EMR system developed using Django Rest Framework for the backend and React TypeScript for the frontend. It aims to provide cost-effective, adaptable, and sustainable healthcare solutions.

## Prerequisites
Before you start contributing, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of:
- Git and GitHub
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Getting Started with Web Development
If you have never coded before, we recommend taking the [WD101 Course](https://www.pupilfirst.school/courses/1802/curriculum) by pupilfirst.school, which covers the basics of web development.

## Learning Django and React
To get familiar with our tech stack, you can follow these courses:
- [DjangoForAll](https://school.ohc.network/courses/1844) for Django and DRF
- [ReactForAll](https://school.ohc.network/courses/1843) for React TypeScript

## Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Clone the Repositories**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/coronasafe/care.git
   git clone https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` files for backend and frontend repositories.

## Understanding the Codebase
- **Backend (Django)**:
  - `care/` - Main application directory
  - `api/` - API endpoints
  - `models/` - Database models
- **Frontend (React)**:
  - `src/` - Source files
  - `components/` - Reusable components
  - `pages/` - Page components

## Coding Standards and Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.

## How to Contribute
1. **Find an Issue**:
   - Browse issues on [care](https://github.com/coronasafe/care/issues) and [care_fe](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/issues).
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue`.

2. **Claim the Issue**:
   - Comment on the issue explaining your approach and request to assign it to you.

3. **Work on the Issue**:
   - Fork the repository and create a new branch.
   - Start coding and commit your changes.
   - Write tests to ensure your changes work as expected.

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Open a draft PR as soon as you make some progress.
   - Request a review once your PR is ready.
   - Address feedback promptly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to resolve merge conflicts?

Often, when you are working on a feature branch and the base branch gets updated in the original repository, conflicts may arise if both you and the base branch modified the same file or lines.

Follow these steps to resolve merge conflicts when syncing your feature branch with the latest changes from the develop branch in the org’s repository:

1. Ensure you have the latest develop branch from the org’s repository:

```bash
# First, verify that you have the org’s repository added as a remote. You can check by running:
git remote -v

# If it’s not added, you can add it using the following command:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe.git
git fetch upstream

# Merge the latest `develop` branch into your working branch
git merge upstream/develop
```

2. Resolve conflicts if any

- If there are merge conflicts, git will pause and show the files with conflicts.
- Open those files in your editor and look for lines like:

```text
 <<<<<<< HEAD
 // Your changes
 =======
 // Changes from upstream
 >>>>>>> upstream/develop
```

- Resolve the conflicts by choosing which changes to keep or combining them as needed. You can use VS Code Editor to resolve these conflicts. [See how](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_merge-conflicts).

3. After resolving the conflicts, mark them as resolved and commit the merge:

```bash
git add .
git commit
```

That's it! Now you can push your changes.
