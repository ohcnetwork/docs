## 3. Onboarding & Training
Interns onboarded will receive access to:
* Training Modules: Tailored to help interns quickly get up to speed on our tools and technology
* Slack Community: A collaborative space for interacting with peers, mentors, and team members

### 3.1 Training 
Our internship emphasizes on-the-go training, allowing interns to dive into real-world projects immediately. Based on their selection, interns are expected to have sufficient knowledge to contribute from day one.

**Training Modules:**
* **Django for all** - This module will equip interns with essential Django concepts which are critical for building and maintaining the backend systems for CARE.
* **CARE 101** - deals in detail with all the different functions and uses of the CARE which allows interns to get familiar with the tool.

The community support system, mentors, and review calls serve as platforms for interns to ask questions, seek clarification, and receive guidance as they work on issues.

Interns are encouraged to learn from each other through community interactions and collaborative problem-solving.

This approach ensures that interns gain practical, relevant experience while contributing to real projects from the start of their internship.

### 3.2 Slack Community 
Open Healthcare Network community operates over slack and interns will have access to specific Slack channels during their internship period. These channels are designed to foster collaboration, facilitate communication, and any other support throughout the program.

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| care_general | This is the primary channel for general announcements, updates, and discussions |
| care_product | For all product related queries, ideation and discussions |
| care_engineering | For all engineering related discussion and doubt clarifications |
| watercooler | A casual space for sharing interesting articles, or discuss non-work-related topics |

The Community Manager will serve as the first point of contact for any general issues or concerns. Will be overseeing students' performance weekly and support struggling students as required.

## 4. How to get started
Interns are responsible for picking up issues to stay active and get stipend.

Refer to the contributors guide to get started with the internship journey.

## 5. Review 
During the internship period, interns will have regular reviews to ensure quality outcome and guidance:

* **Daily Reports**: Daily short update on work done to be shared over slack channel end of every day
* **EOD calls**: Daily 30-minute check-ins via Zoom at 7:30 PM to share updates and address doubts
* **Weekly Review calls**: Mandatory 1-hour Zoom call every Tuesday at 7:30 PM for all interns to receive real-time feedback from senior engineers
* **Pull Request - Q&A and code review**: All PRs will go through a Q&A check. PRs that pass the Q&A will be shared with engineers for code review. Only merged PRs will be counted towards story point allocation for the month, so plan your submissions accordingly

Attendance for review calls are mandatory to maintain active status.

## 6. Mandatory guidelines to be followed

### General Guidelines
The internship is fully remote, offering interns the flexibility to work according to their own schedule. However, onboarded interns are required to join the scheduled weekly calls and submit a daily report, even if it's a 'no work done' report, to ensure consistent communication and progress tracking.

### Work Expectations and Monitoring
* Interns can go through the training modules while picking up issues and working on the same
* Interns will be responsible for selecting issues and working on them to meet their monthly story point requirements. They should not wait for mentors to assign tasks
* Only merged Pull Requests (PRs) will be considered for story point and stipend payouts
* All interns are expected to submit fully functional PRs. The review process should not be relied upon to correct incomplete or low-quality work
* Any doubts must be clarified with team members before submitting the PR to ensure it meets the required standards
* PRs submitted by interns will be reviewed to ensure that they are not attempting to game the system by completing low-effort issues to accumulate story points
* **Avoid Issue Hoarding**: Interns should not take on more issues than they can manage. Work should begin immediately after assignment
* **Avoid Abandoning Issues**: If an issue is beyond your capabilities, inform the community manager and explain why

### Review Mechanism 
* Mandatory daily EOD report submission on Slack
* Weekly Review Call: Mandatory attendance every Tuesday from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM
* Daily EOD Calls: Monday through Saturday at 7:30 PM (minimum one attendance per week required)
* Individual review calls scheduled as needed

### Leave Policy
During the 6-month internship period, each intern can take a maximum of 1 month of unpaid leave, subject to prior communication and approval from the Community Manager.

### Management Authority
The team reserves the right to restructure the internship structure anytime without prior notice.
