## Architecture & Request Flow

At its core, Scribe acts as a bridge between a care form and an AI modelâ€”prompting the model to fill out the form using the relevant context it provides.

  A[User Records voice] --> B[Transcribe Model converts voice to text]
  B --> C[Data to autofill is sent to LLM]
  C --> D[LLM fills the form and triggers a tool call]
  D --> E[Backend returns the filled form]
  E --> F[Frontend stitches the response and fetches any valueset codes]
  F --> G[Updated data is displayed to the user]
  G --> H{User confirms data}
  H -- Yes --> I[Form is updated in Care]
    H -- No --> J[User can edit the transcribed text]
    H -- No --> K[User can retranscribe the voice/image]
    H -- No --> A
  OCR[User Uploads Image] --> C
