## Feature Flow

This section details the operational flow of the Care Scribe feature, from the initiation of voice recording to the final form submission.

### High-Level Feature Operation

Care Scribe enhances user interaction with form fields through voice commands. The feature operates by:

1. Initiating voice recording when a user visits a form and activates the 'Voice Autofill' option.
2. Stopping the recording on user command and processing the audio data.
3. Transcribing the voice recording into text and mapping the transcription to the relevant form fields.
4. Updating the form with the transcribed data and submitting it to the backend.

The process is designed to be intuitive and efficient, minimizing the need for manual text entry and reducing the potential for data entry errors.

### Detailed Flowchart Explanation

![flowchart](assets/flowchart.png)

The flowchart outlines the step-by-step process of the Care Scribe feature. Below is an explanation of each step:

- **Form Visit**: The user navigates to a form within the application.
- **Click Voice Autofill**: The user initiates the voice autofill feature.
- **Start Voice Recording**: Care Scribe begins recording the user's voice inputs.
- **User Clicks Stop Button**: The user ends the voice recording session.
- **Recording Reaches 20 MB or ~23 Minutes**: The system automatically starts a new recording session to prevent data loss and ensure manageable file sizes.
- **Start New Recording**: If the initial recording session is stopped manually or reaches the file size/time limit, a new recording session begins.
- **Push to Buffer[]**: Audio data is temporarily stored in a buffer as it is being processed.
- **Collect Recorded Files**: The audio files are collected for transcription.
- **POST /scribe**: The system creates a new Scribe object with `requested_by`, `form_data`, and sets the status to 'Created'.
- **PUT CreateUpload**: Prepares the collected files for upload.
- **For Each Collected File**: Each audio file undergoes the following process:
  - **Use external_id as association_id for Files**: Links the audio files to the corresponding form instance.
  - **Post Audio binary to signed S3 URL for the FileUpload object**: Uploads the audio to a secure S3 bucket.
  - **File Upload**: Completes the file upload process.
- **Poll /AIFormFill**: The system polls for the status of the AIFormFill object to be 'Completed' or 'Failed'.
- **Get Form Data**: Retrieves the latest form data.
- **Update State with New Form Data**: Updates the application state with the new data from the form.
- **Get AIFormFill Object**: Accesses the AIFormFill object for processing.
- **Fetch Audio Files**: Retrieves the audio files associated with the AIFormFill object.
- **Get S3 Signed URLs**: Obtains secure URLs for the audio files stored in S3.
- **Fetch Audio Content**: Downloads the audio content from S3.
- **Transcribe with Whisper API**: Uses the Whisper API to transcribe audio content to text.
- **Transcript -> Form Data**: Maps the transcribed text to the appropriate form fields.
- **Store Form Data**: Saves the mapped form data.
- **Update Status to Completed**: Sets the AIFormFill object's status to 'Completed' after a successful operation.
- **Celery Worker**: An asynchronous Celery worker performs tasks such as polling the status and updating the form data.

Each of these steps represents a critical point in the operational flow of the Care Scribe feature, ensuring a seamless and efficient form-filling experience for the user.

## Scribe Integration

This section of the documentation details the integration of the Care Scribe feature into the Care application backend, describing the functionalities, database migrations, API endpoints, and background job scheduling.

### Modules

The Care Scribe feature is composed of several key components that work together to enable voice-assisted form filling. Below we will detail each module's functionality and how they interact within the system.

**Frontend Voice Recorder with Audio Size Splitting**

The voice recorder is a critical component that manages the audio input from the user. It uses the `useSegmentedRecorder` custom hook to handle the recording process. This hook facilitates the splitting of audio data into manageable chunks to prevent file size from becoming too large, which is essential for efficient data transfer and processing.

```jsx
// Example usage of useSegmentedRecorder hook
const { isRecording, startRecording, stopRecording, audioBlobs } =
  useSegmentedRecorder();
```

When the audio reaches a predefined size limit or time duration, the recorder stops the current recording session and starts a new one, ensuring seamless user experience and data integrity.

**Uploading Files to S3**

Once the audio is recorded, the files are prepared for upload. This process involves creating a signed URL for secure file transfer and then uploading the audio data to an Amazon S3 bucket. This is handled within the `Scribe` component, which interacts with backend API routes designed for file management.

```jsx
// Example of the upload function within the Scribe component
const uploadAudio = async (audioBlob, associatingId) => {
  // ...code to handle file upload to S3...
};
```

**Backend Transcription and Data Extraction Task**

On the backend, a task is triggered to process the uploaded audio files. This involves several steps:

1. **Fetching Audio Files**: Retrieving the audio files from S3.
2. **Transcription**: Using OpenAI's Whisper to convert speech to text.
3. **Data Extraction**: Applying GPT-4 Turbo to interpret the transcript and extract structured form data.
4. **Task Completion**: Updating the `Scribe` object's status to 'Completed' and storing the extracted form data.

These steps are handled by a background worker task that ensures the process is asynchronous and does not block other operations.

**Frontend Form Filling**

After the backend processing is complete, the frontend `Scribe` component receives the structured form data. It then updates the relevant form fields accordingly, providing a smooth user experience. The component listens for changes in the `Scribe` object's status and reacts by filling in the form fields when the data becomes available.

```jsx
// Example callback function to update form state
onFormUpdate={(fields) => {
  // Update form state with the new data
}};
```

**Module Interaction**

The frontend voice recorder module starts the process by capturing the user's voice and splitting the audio as needed. It then interacts with the S3 upload module to transfer the files securely. Once uploaded, the backend task takes over to transcribe and extract data from the audio files, utilizing powerful AI models. Finally, the structured form data is sent back to the frontend, where the form-filling module populates the form fields with the extracted data, completing the cycle.

By understanding the functionalities and interactions of these modules, developers can maintain, troubleshoot, and extend the Care Scribe feature as required.

### Functionalities

The Care Scribe module adds voice recognition and form autofill capabilities to the Care application. The key functionalities include:

- **Voice Recording Management**: Handling the start and stop of voice recordings, managing file buffers, and pushing audio data to storage.
- **Form Data Processing**: Collecting and structuring form data, validating it against a JSON schema, and preparing it for AI processing.
- **AI Interaction**: Integrating with AI services for transcribing audio to text and generating AI responses to fill the form data.

Key components added with this feature include:

- `Scribe`: A Django model that represents the form filling session and stores the transcription, AI response, and the status of the processing.
- `ScribeFile`: Extends the `FileUpload` model to handle specific file types associated with the Scribe feature.
- `ScribeSerializer`: Handles the serialization and deserialization of Scribe data for RESTful interaction.

### Database Migrations

The integration includes migrations to create new models in the database:

- `0001_initial.py`: This migration sets up the initial structure of the `Scribe` and `ScribeFile` models in the database.

### API Endpoints

New endpoints are added to manage the Scribe feature:

- `/api/scribe/`: Endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating `Scribe` objects.
- `/api/scribe_file/`: Endpoints for managing the file uploads related to the `Scribe` objects.

These endpoints allow the frontend to start a form filling session, manage audio file uploads, and fetch the status and results of the AI processing.

### Background Jobs and Scheduling

To process the audio recordings asynchronously and update the form data with AI-generated responses, Care Scribe leverages Celery, a distributed task queue:

- `tasks/scribe.py`: Defines the Celery tasks for processing form fillings, such as `process_ai_form_fill`, which coordinates the AI transcription and response generation.

These tasks are queued up when a `Scribe` object's status is set to 'Ready' and are processed in the background without blocking the main application flow.

#### Pseudocode of Celery Task

Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of the Celery task for processing AI form fillings:

1. Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. Define global variable `OpenAIClient`.
3. Define function `get_openai_client` to initialize `OpenAIClient` if it's not already initialized.
4. Define two prompts for the AI model.
5. Define a shared task function `process_ai_form_fill` that takes an `external_id` as input.
   1. Filter `Scribe` objects based on `external_id` and status.
   2. Loop over each form in the filtered `Scribe` objects.
      1. If the form doesn't have any audio files, log a warning and continue to the next form.
      2. Log the start of processing for the current form.
      3. Initialize an empty list for audio file URLs and an empty string for transcript.
      4. Loop over each audio file ID in the form's audio file IDs.
         1. Get the `ScribeFile` object for the current audio file ID.
         2. Append the signed URL of the audio file to the list of audio file URLs.
         3. Log the audio file URL.
      5. Try the following steps, and if any exception occurs, log the error and set the form status to 'FAILED'.
         1. Log the start of transcript generation for the current form and set the form status to 'GENERATING_TRANSCRIPT'.
         2. If the form doesn't have a transcript, generate a transcript using the OpenAI client and save it to the form.
         3. Log the start of AI response generation for the current form and set the form status to 'GENERATING_AI_RESPONSE'.
         4. Process the transcript with the OpenAI client to generate an AI response.
         5. Log the AI response.
         6. Save the AI response to the form and set the form status to 'COMPLETED'.

The task is designed to handle various steps in the AI form filling process, including error handling to update the `Scribe` status to 'Failed' if any step encounters an issue.

## Configuring Care Scribe with AI Services

Care Scribe supports integration with both OpenAI and Azure AI services. This section provides detailed instructions on configuring the service with these providers, the differences between the configurations, and the environment variables that need to be set.

### Differences Between OpenAI and Azure AI Integration

- **API Provider**: The service can be configured to use either `OpenAI` or `Azure` as the AI backend.
- **API Endpoint**: Azure requires an additional endpoint setting (`AZURE_ENDPOINT`), whereas OpenAI uses a default endpoint set within the library.
- **API Version**: Azure integration allows specifying an API version (`AZURE_API_VERSION`), which is not required for OpenAI.
- **Model Naming**: For Azure, the model or custom deployment name is used, while OpenAI directly uses the model name provided by OpenAI.

### Required Settings Variables

The following environment variables need to be configured depending on your choice of AI service provider:

- `API_PROVIDER`: Set to either `"openai"` or `"azure"` to choose the AI service provider.
- `TRANSCRIBE_SERVICE_PROVIDER_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing transcription services from the chosen provider.
- `AZURE_API_VERSION` (only for Azure): Specifies the version of the Azure API to use.
- `AZURE_ENDPOINT` (only for Azure): Specifies the endpoint URL for Azure services.
- `AUDIO_MODEL_NAME`: The model name for audio transcription services (OpenAI) or the custom deployment name for Azure.
- `CHAT_MODEL_NAME`: The model name for chat services (OpenAI) or the custom deployment name for Azure.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Based on the chosen provider, set the appropriate environment variables in `plugin_settings`.

   For OpenAI:

   ```python
   plugin_settings.API_PROVIDER = 'openai'
   plugin_settings.TRANSCRIBE_SERVICE_PROVIDER_API_KEY = '<your_openai_api_key>'
   plugin_settings.AUDIO_MODEL_NAME = '<openai_audio_model_name>'
   plugin_settings.CHAT_MODEL_NAME = '<openai_chat_model_name>'
   ```

   For Azure:

   ```python
   plugin_settings.API_PROVIDER = 'azure'
   plugin_settings.TRANSCRIBE_SERVICE_PROVIDER_API_KEY = '<your_azure_api_key>'
   plugin_settings.AZURE_API_VERSION = '<api_version>'
   plugin_settings.AZURE_ENDPOINT = '<azure_endpoint>'
   plugin_settings.AUDIO_MODEL_NAME = '<azure_custom_deployment_name_for_audio>'
   plugin_settings.CHAT_MODEL_NAME = '<azure_custom_deployment_name_for_chat>'
   ```

2. **Initialize AI Client**: The AI client initialization is handled within the `get_openai_client` function, which now dynamically selects the AI service based on the `API_PROVIDER` setting.

3. **Usage in Tasks**: Use the configured AI client in your tasks to perform AI-related operations like audio transcription and chat completions, ensuring you set the model or deployment names correctly.

By following these configuration steps and setting the appropriate variables, Care Scribe will be able to interact with the chosen AI service provider efficiently and securely.

## Frontend Integration

![UI](assets/frontend.png)

Integrating the Care Scribe feature into the frontend involves updating the React components, state management, event handling, and ensuring the UI/UX and accessibility features are considered.

### Frontend Architecture Overview

The frontend architecture is built on React, utilizing functional components and hooks for state management. The integration of Care Scribe adds new components related to voice recording and form handling, which interact with the backend API.

### Components and State Management

New components and hooks have been introduced to manage the state of voice recording and form data:

- `Scribe.tsx`: The primary component that handles voice recording, audio data management, and interaction with the backend to post form data.
- `formDetails.ts`: Contains the metadata and schema of form fields that can be auto-filled using the Scribe feature, exported as `SCRIBE_FORMS`
- `useSegmentedRecorder.ts`: A custom hook that manages voice recording, including starting, stopping, and segmenting the audio as it's recorded.

The state of the Scribe component is managed using local state hooks like `useState` and external state management with API interactions.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers within the Scribe component control the flow of user interactions:

- Voice recording is initiated and controlled through button clicks, triggering corresponding methods in the `useSegmentedRecorder` hook.
- Form updates are handled via callbacks when the transcription process is completed and the data is ready to be filled in the form.

### UI/UX Considerations

UI updates include:

- Adding a microphone icon to indicate voice recording capability.
- Visual feedback during recording, processing, and transcription phases.
- Modals and progress indicators to enhance user feedback during the operation of the Scribe feature.

#### Code Snippets

The following snippets from the patch files demonstrate key aspects of the Scribe feature integration:

```jsx
// src/Components/Scribe/Scribe.tsx
// Example of the Scribe component initialization for the daily round form in CARE
<Scribe
  fields={DAILY_ROUND_FORM_SCRIBE_DATA} // Form field metadata

  },
  {
    friendlyName: "Investigations",
    id: "investigations",
    type: `{
      type: string[], 
      repetitive: boolean, 
      time?: string, 
      frequency?: '15 min' | '30 min' | '1 hr' | '6 hrs' | '12 hrs' | '24 hrs' | '48 hrs', 
      notes?: string
    }[]`,
    default: [],
    example: `[
      {
        type: ["Haemotology (GROUP)"],
        repetitive: false,
        time: "2024-07-31T18:10",
        notes: "Patient is allergic to penicillin."      
      },
      {
        type: ["ECG", "X-Ray"],
        repetitive: true,
        frequency: "24 hrs",
        notes: "Patient is going nuts"
      }
    ]`,
    description:

The time field should be of the example format if present - (2024-07-31T18:10). The notes field should be a string. If the type is not available in options, DO NOT MAKE IT.",
    validator: (value) => {
      if (!Array.isArray(value)) return false;
      value.forEach((i) => {
        if (!i.type || !i.repetitive) return false;
        if (i.repetitive && !i.frequency) return false;
      });
      return true;
    },
  },
  // Additional fields...
];

// All metadata for all forms, combined with dynamic options if any
export const SCRIBE_FORMS: { [key: string]: ScribeForm } = {
  daily_round: {
    // key name can be anything, but we prefer to keep it as the name of the form
    id: "daily_round", // id of the form
    name: "Daily Round", // name of the form
    fields: async () => {
      // fields of the form

      // if the form needs dynamic options from the server, we fetch them here.
      const investigations = await loadInvestigations();

      return DAILY_ROUND_FORM_SCRIBE_DATA.map((field) => {
        if (field.id === "investigations") {
          return {
            ...field,
            options: investigations.map((investigation, i) => ({
              id: i,
              text: investigation,
            })),
          };
        }
        return field;
      });
    },
  },
};
```

### Handling Dynamic and Exhaustive Options

In typical scenarios, a dropdown menu contains predefined options embedded directly into the frontend code, making it straightforward to pass these options to Scribe. This is achieved by simply assigning a variable to the form's metadata. However, certain cases require fetching options from the server that are extensive in nature. For instance, consider the investigations we recently fetched and integrated into our request to Scribe.

In some situations, dropdown options are too exhaustive (e.g., thousands of ICD-11 diagnoses). In such cases, it is neither practical nor efficient to pass all options to Scribe. Instead, we take a different approach: we do not send any options to Scribe, allowing it to return exactly what the user inputs as text. This text is then sent to the frontend, which queries the necessary endpoints using the input value as a search term and presents the relevant options to the user.

#### Example Configuration

```js
{
  friendlyName: "Diagnosis",
  id: "icd11_diagnosis",
  type: '{diagnosis: string, verification_status: "unconfirmed" | "provisional" | "differential" |"confirmed", is_principal: boolean}[]',
  default: [],
  example:
    "[{diagnosis: '4A42.0 Paediatric onset systemic sclerosis', verification_status: 'confirmed', is_principal: true}, {diagnosis: '2', verification_status: 'provisional', is_principal: false}]",
  description:
    "A list of objects to store the patient's diagnosis along with their verification status and whether it is the principal diagnosis. If not specifically stated, set is_principal to false. NOTE: only one principal diagnosis can exist. The diagnosis field should be a string that may contain a corresponding diagnosis ID. The verification_status field should be a string with one of the following values: 'unconfirmed', 'provisional', 'differential', or 'confirmed'.",
  validator: (value) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(value)) return false;
    for (const d of value) {
      if (!d.diagnosis || !d.verification_status) return false;

#### Future Considerations

While this method effectively manages large datasets, future improvements could involve implementing a vector database that directly interfaces with Scribe. This enhancement would streamline the process by efficiently handling and querying large sets of data, thereby improving both performance and user experience.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

Here's a list of potential problems users might encounter while using the Care Scribe feature, along with solutions to address them:

**Issue:** Voice recording fails to start.
**Solution:**

- Ensure that the user has granted microphone access to the browser.
- Verify that the microphone is functioning correctly and is not being used by another application.
- Check the browser console for any error messages related to audio capture.

**Issue:** Transcription accuracy is low.
**Solution:**

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace during the recording.
- Avoid background noise that might interfere with the audio capture.
- Consider using a higher-quality microphone for better audio input.

**Issue:** Form data is not mapped correctly to the fields.
**Solution:**

- Review the form field metadata in formDetails.ts to ensure the friendlyName and id attributes are accurate and match the form structure.
- Check the transcript for any errors or inconsistencies that might cause misinterpretation during the data extraction process.

**Issue:** AI response generation is taking too long.
**Solution:**

- Verify that the backend task queue is running and processing tasks efficiently.
- Check the performance of the AI service and ensure it is responding within acceptable timeframes.
- Consider optimizing the AI prompts and data structures to improve the response time.

#### Logging and Error Tracking

Care Scribe utilizes logging mechanisms to record events and errors during the operation of the feature:

- **Frontend Logging:** The Scribe component logs events and errors to the browser console using the console.log and console.error methods.
- **Backend Logging:** The Django application logs events and errors to the server logs using the Python logging module.

Sentry.io is utilized for error tracking and capturing errors from both the frontend and the backend loggers, offering real-time monitoring and reporting of errors. This provides valuable insights into potential issues and areas that require improvement.

### Appendix

#### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets demonstrating key aspects of the Care Scribe implementation:

Frontend Voice Recorder Initialization:

```
// Example of initializing the voice recorder with the useSegmentedRecorder hook
const {
  isRecording,
  startRecording,
  stopRecording,
  audioBlobs,
} = useSegmentedRecorder({
  onNewBlob: handleNewAudioBlob,
  maxBlobDuration: 23 * 60 * 1000, // 23 minutes in milliseconds
  maxBlobSize: 20 * 1024 * 1024, // 20 MB in bytes
});
```

Backend Celery Task for AI Form Fill:

```
@shared_task
def process_ai_form_fill(external_id):
    scribe_obj = Scribe.objects.get(external_id=external_id)
    # ...code to process the audio files and generate the AI response...
    scribe_obj.status = 'Completed'
    scribe_obj.ai_response = ai_response
    scribe_obj.save()
```

Form Field Metadata Example:

```
// Example of form field metadata for the Scribe feature
export const DAILY_ROUND_FORM_SCRIBE_DATA: Field[] = [
  {
    friendlyName: "Temperature",
    id: "temperature",
    type: "number",
    example: "98.6",
    // Other field attributes...
  },
  // Additional fields...
];
```

These snippets provide a glimpse into the inner workings of the Care Scribe feature and can be helpful for understanding its implementation details.
