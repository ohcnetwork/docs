# Scan and Share Feature in CARE

The Scan and Share feature in CARE is designed to help patients register quickly by scanning a QR code at the hospital counter. This eliminates the need to stand in a long queue. Once the QR is scanned and the initial registration is complete, patients are directed to a special ABDM queue to continue the rest of their registration process.

For more details on the feature, visit [ABDM Scan and Share](https://abdm.gov.in/scan-share).

## Creating the QR Code

There are two ways to generate the Scan and Share QR code for a facility:

### 1. Using ABDM's Health Facility Dashboard

- **Reference Document:**  
  Follow the Software Linkage section in the [User Manual](https://sandboxcms.abdm.gov.in/uploads/User_Manual_New_58c71f13dc.pdf).

### 2. Using CARE

1. Open CARE and navigate to the facility settings page.

2. Click on **Configure Health Facility**.

3. Link the Health Facility ID, if not already linked.

4. Enter a Counter ID (any alpha numeric value is valid; use dashes or underscores instead of spaces; if not applicable, simply use `1`).

5. Click on **Download QR Code**.
