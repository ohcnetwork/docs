# CEP for offline support project

This document lists the standard workflows that will be supported offline and  how we can achive this.  
Each workflow has an associated markdown table that defines the structure, HTTP method, and other important information about the API endpoints involved.

In the tables, backend API endpoints are clearly distinguished based on whether they will be **cached** or **stored and later synced via IndexedDB (for write operations).**

These  tables give us idea about which  dynamic data need to be cached for offlien support   and help to avoid store unnecessary data.

## Standard Workflows

- [1. Patient Registration and Search Patient Workflow](#1-patient-registration-and-search-patient-workflow)  
- [2. Encounter Management and Questionnaire Filling](#2-encounter-management-and-questionnaire-filling)  
- [3. Patient Profile management](#3-patient-profile-management)  
- [4. Appointments Management](#4-appointments-management)

## 1. Patient Registration and Search Patient Workflow
Patient registration and search patient workflow include add new patient and search patient by its mobile number.After click on one of the search patient ,user go to page from where they can create encounter,schedule appointments,see encounters list of that patient.This table mainly include endpoints regarding add patient and search patient only . create encounter,list encounter come under the encounter management and schedule appointment come under the appointment management.

 pattern of Read only Api that going to be cached :
 1. URL starts with `/api/v1/getcurrentuser`          
 2. URL starts with `/api/v1/organization`          
 3. URL matches `/api/v1/facility/:facilityId/`       


  Note: (3,4) are the post type read only api so we need to store them into indexed when user hit them during online. and (8) is the write operation api.

## Key Assumptions and Design Considerations for Offline Mode :
 
 Before implementing offline support, it’s essential to define how the application determines internet connectivity and how it behaves in various online/offline scenarios. This document outlines the design assumptions and expected behavior around connection status handling.

 We use a real server connectivity check instead of navigator.onLine. This involves pinging a known backend endpoint (e.g., /ping) and marking the user as offline if the server is unreachable.

 We maintain a global state variable isOnline to represent the app’s understanding of the user’s connectivity. This value can be:
 - set based on real server checks during page reload and websites open .
 - Manually overridden by the user via a toggle.

 ### Offline Mode Toggle Button
 The app provides an "Enable Offline Mode" toggle button in the UI.This gives users control when internet conditions are unstable, allowing them to continue working in offline mode without interruptions.
 
 we Use an Explicit `isOnline` State Instead of Just Runtime Checks because Automatic checks can flicker rapidly when internet connectivity is poor (e.g., intermittent mobile data). This can cause unpredictable app behavior, like failed fetches or UI state inconsistencies. Manual offline mode offers a **clear and consistent user experience**. Users understand when they're offline and what features are expected to work

 - Enabled = isOnline = false: User manually forces the app into offline mode to prevent unstable behavior during intermittent   connectivity.
 - Disabled = isOnline = true: The app will attempt to connect to the server normally.

### Behavior on App Load and Connectivity Events

#### 1. App Launch (Fresh Tab Open)
- On opening the app, `checkRealServer()` is called.
- If the server is reachable → `isOnline = true` or If unreachable → `isOnline = false`..
- Ensures `isOnline` reflects real connectivity at startup.
---

#### 2. Login Attempt During Poor Connectivity
- If the user is **not logged in** and connectivity is poor,then Login may fail:
- App offers **fallback login** using last cached profile (if available).
- It  Allows access even when login fails due to network issues.
---

#### 3. User Goes Offline During Active Session
  - If already logged in and internet becomes unstable:
  - User can toggle **offline mode manually** → `isOnline = false`.
  - Enables offline features (e.g., cached reads, local writes).
---

#### 4. Page Reload or Tab Reopen
- On reload or reopening , `checkRealServer()` runs again and Updates `isOnline` state.:
- Notifies user of current connection status.
- Even if user previously forced offline mode, connection is revalidated.

### Role based caching , when multiple users access the app on the same device
- As Care have role based access control, we  have  to ensure that if multiple user access the app on same device  then their data of one user does not override the other user data while caching. Its necessary because permissions are come from backend via api based on user. For example, the getCurrentUser API returns a list of permissions specific to the logged-in user. If this response is cached and a different user logs in, their permissions could overwrite the previous user's data. Later, if the first user tries to use the app offline, they might see incorrect permissions or data from the second user.

so to ovrcome this problem we have to cache data per user. we will discussed its solution in approache's section.


# Now Lets Discussed Approches to achive offline Support :
 The approaches discussed here focus primarily on caching API responses. Our UI shell is already cached by default since CARE is a PWA. Below are some of the approaches we can use to achieve offline functionality for the workflows we’ve discussed.

---

### 1. Using TanStack Query Cache with Persistence
This approach plays around using TanStack Query to cache the API responses and sync write operations once the app comes back online. Persistence, in this context, here means to store the cached data into some local DB (e.g., IndexedDB). Since CARE already uses TanStack Query for fetch and write operations, integrating persistence and offline syncing becomes relatively straightforward. This approach leverages existing infrastructure, reducing the need for additional caching logic or custom data handling. Now let's discuss what configuration needs to be implemented for this approach.

#### 1. Persister:
It is the mechanism that defines how and where the data is saved/restored. TanStack provides some persisters like `createSyncStoragePersister` for mainly localStorage and `createAsyncStoragePersister` for AsyncStorage. It also provides a method to create a custom persister. We will create a custom persister for IndexedDB(via dexie.js) for our use case.

 We just need to create a createDbPersister() function that returns our custom persister. Inside this function, we define a single cache key under which the entire React Query cache will be stored. The function should implement three methods — `persistClient()`, `restoreClient()`, and `removeClient()` — following the rules to create a custom persister for React Query.

When online, data fetched using useQuery is stored in the in-memory cache and also persisted to IndexedDB via this custom persister. When offline, the cached data stored in IndexedDB (using Dexie.js) is automatically hydrated back into the in-memory cache. TanStack Query then manages the cache seamlessly, providing offline support without extra effort.

#### 2. cacheTime(or  gcTime) and maxage:
For persist to work properly, we  have to  pass `QueryClient` a `cacheTime`. `cacheTime` should be set as the same value or higher than `persistQueryClient`'s `maxAge` option. 

- `cacheTime` defines how long inactive cached data stays in memory before being garbage collected. This means the data remains available for queries without refetching during this time, even if not actively used. 
- `maxAge` (used in persistQueryClient) determines how long the persisted cache data remains valid and can be restored from storage.

#### 4. PersistQueryClientProvider:
`PersistQueryClientProvider` is a React wrapper around our normal `QueryClientProvider` that automatically restores persisted cache on mount and keeps it in sync through subscribe/unsubscribe. It prevents our queries from fetching until the cache is hydrated, ensuring a smooth offline‑first experience.

 **lets discuss how to overcome the problem of cache mixing when multiple user use same device :** TanStack Query caches all API data fetched via useQuery. To avoid mixing cached data between different users, include the userId as part of the queryKey along with other parameters. Since TanStack Query stores cache data based on the queryKey (not just the URL), adding userId creates distinct cache entries even if the API endpoint (URL) is the same. This ensures each user’s data is cached separately.
 (Unlike Workbox, which caches based on URL, TanStack Query relies on the uniqueness of the query key.)
 
 **Note:** To avoid unnecessary refetch attempts when offline, configure useQuery with enabled: isOnline === true. This way, during online mode, staleTime can remain 0 to always fetch fresh data. When offline, the query is disabled (enabled: false), so cached data is used without triggering refetches that would fail.
 This approach keeps the default online behavior unchanged while ensuring smooth offline caching without forced stale data refetches.

 Main advantages of this approches is :
 - It will cache data coming from api that was fetch using useQuery irrespective of operation we use(eg.GET,POST).But Approches like workbox does not provide such option's they will cache only get api responses not read only post responses.
 - As Care is already using tanstack query it become easy to implement this approch in the CARE. we dont have to write 
 - Give option to separate cached data based on user by using just single userid in query key.But if we use aproches like workbox we have to add userid in url to  store data in cache based on url, it can increase  complexity.
