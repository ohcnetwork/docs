# Service Request

### Summary

In FHIR, a `ServiceRequest` represents an order or proposal to perform a clinical or non-clinical action for a patient. It can lead to the creation of related resources like `Procedure`, `Observation`, `Specimen`, or `DiagnosticReport`, though these are optional and context-dependent.
