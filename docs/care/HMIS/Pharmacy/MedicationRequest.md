### Functional Workflow

1. **Prescription Creation**: A healthcare provider creates a MedicationRequest during a patient encounter.
2. **Review and Approval**: The prescription is reviewed and approved as per facility protocols.
3. **Dispensing**: The pharmacy dispenses the medication as per the prescription details.
4. **Administration and Monitoring**: The patient administers the medication, and adherence is monitored.
5. **Status Updates**: The status of the MedicationRequest is updated based on the medication's lifecycle (e.g., completed, stopped).
