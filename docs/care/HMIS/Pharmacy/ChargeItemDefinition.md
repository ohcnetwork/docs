### Summary

The **Charge Item Definition** resource in the CARE system outlines the billing rules and pricing details associated with healthcare services and products. It serves as a blueprint for how charges are calculated, considering various factors such as patient demographics, service context, and applicable taxes.

This resource aligns with FHIR's [ChargeItemDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/chargeitemdefinition.html) resource, providing a standardized framework for representing billing information.[FHIR Build](https://build.fhir.org/chargeitemdefinition.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Functional Workflow

1. **Definition Creation**: A Charge Item Definition is created, detailing the billing rules and pricing structures for specific services or products.
2. **Automated Charge Generation**: When clinical data is entered (e.g., medication requests), the system automatically generates corresponding charge items based on the definitions.
3. **Conditional Pricing**: The system evaluates patient and encounter data against the applicability conditions to determine the appropriate pricing.
4. **Tax Calculation**: Applicable taxes are calculated based on configured tax codes and added to the total charge.
5. **Billing Integration**: The final charge, including all components, is integrated into the billing system for invoicing and payment processing.
