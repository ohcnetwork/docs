### Summary

In the CARE system, a **Product** refers to any item that can be purchased from the facility. This encompasses:

- [Medications](https://build.fhir.org/medication.html)
- [Nutritional Products](https://build.fhir.org/nutritionproduct.html)
- Consumables

These items can be requested for a patient through a Medication Request. Although the terminology might seem counterintuitive, this design choice was made to streamline the ordering process.

Requested products are dispensed via the Medication Dispense process.

The **Product** resource in CARE is a culmination of multiple FHIR resource references. While it deviates from FHIR's standard structure, it maintains the capability to create individual FHIR resources when necessary.

A **Product** is an instantiation of **Product Knowledge**. All pertinent details are housed within the Product Knowledge resource, whereas the Product resource captures data unique to a specific batch, such as batch number and expiry date.

Additionally, a Product is linked to a Charge Item Definition, facilitating the creation of Charge Items whenever the product is billed.

### Key Purpose

- Represent purchasable items within the facility.
- Differentiate between general product information (Product Knowledge) and batch-specific details.
- Integrate with billing systems through Charge Item Definitions.
- Ensure compatibility with FHIR resources for interoperability.

### Functional Workflow

1. **Product Knowledge Creation**: General information about a product is entered into the Product Knowledge resource.
2. **Product Instantiation**: For each batch received, a Product resource is created, referencing the Product Knowledge and including batch-specific details.
3. **Billing Integration**: The Product resource links to a Charge Item Definition, ensuring accurate billing when the product is dispensed.
4. **Dispensing Process**: Products are dispensed to patients through the Medication Dispense process, with all relevant information captured.
