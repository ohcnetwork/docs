### Summary

This resource stores all foundational information about a given product, foundational information is anything need not be duplicated across different individual products, ie ingredient lists, possible allergens, nutritional information and so on..

All Products will have a Product Knowledge item in Care.

## Production Knowledge can be instance or facility level.

### Key Purpose

- Define comprehensive, facility-wide information about products.
- Standardize product data across different batches and instances.
- Facilitate integration with FHIR resources for interoperability.
- Support inventory management, prescribing, and dispensing processes.

### Functional Workflow

1. **Creation**: A Product Knowledge entry is created with comprehensive details about a product, including its classification, composition, and storage guidelines.
2. **Reference**: Individual Product instances reference the Product Knowledge entry, inheriting its general attributes while specifying batch-specific details.
3. **Integration**: The Product Knowledge resource integrates with FHIR resources like MedicationKnowledge and NutritionProduct, facilitating interoperability across systems.
4. **Maintenance**: Updates to product information, such as changes in composition or storage guidelines, are made within the Product Knowledge resource, ensuring consistency across all related Product instances.
