# Supply Delivery

### 📋 Summary

The **Supply Delivery** resource in the CARE system records the delivery of healthcare-related items, such as medications, devices, or other supplies, to a specified location. It serves as a critical component in inventory management, ensuring accurate tracking of stock levels within healthcare facilities.

This resource aligns with FHIR's [SupplyDelivery](https://build.fhir.org/supplydelivery.html) resource, facilitating standardized communication and interoperability in supply chain processes.

### 🎯 Key Purpose

- Document the delivery of healthcare items to specific locations.
- Facilitate inventory management by updating stock levels upon delivery.
- Support auditing and tracking of supply movements within the facility.

### 🔁 Functional Workflow

1. **Initiation**: A Supply Request is finalized, prompting the creation of a corresponding Supply Delivery with the stage set to "dispatched."
2. **Dispatch**: Items are deducted from the inventory of the origin location upon dispatch.
3. **Receipt**: Upon arrival, the destination location verifies the quantity and condition of the items.
4. **Inventory Update**: If accepted, items are added to the destination's inventory.
5. **Discrepancy Handling**: If discrepancies or damages are noted, the delivery may be rejected, prompting a return to the origin and the creation of a new Supply Delivery.
6. **Audit Trail**: All status changes and actions are recorded in the status history for auditing purposes.
