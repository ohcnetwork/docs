### Summary

The **InventoryItem** resource represents the availability of a specific product at a given location. It is primarily used for inventory management within healthcare facilities, ensuring accurate tracking of stock levels for medications and other products.

Inventory items are automatically created and updated, typically when a supply delivery is marked as completed.

An inventory item can be marked as inactive to indicate that it is no longer actively dispensed by the pharmacy, possibly due to damage or other concerns.

### Functional Workflow

1. **Supply Delivery Completion**: When a supply delivery is marked as completed, corresponding inventory items are automatically created or updated to reflect the new stock levels.
2. **Inventory Updates**: Any changes in stock levels, such as dispensing or receiving products, result in automatic updates to the inventory items.
3. **Status Management**: Inventory items can be marked as inactive to indicate that they are no longer actively dispensed, possibly due to damage or other concerns.
4. **Inventory Auditing**: Regular audits can be conducted by reviewing the inventory items, their statuses, and quantities to ensure accurate stock management.
