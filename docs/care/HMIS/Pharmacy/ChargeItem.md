### üìã Summary

The **Charge Item** resource in the CARE system captures financial details associated with services rendered or products supplied to a patient. It serves as a self-contained record, detailing the origin of the charge, the amount, applied discounts, taxes, and other relevant financial information.

Charge Items are intrinsically linked to both an **Account** and an **Encounter**, ensuring accurate tracking and billing within the patient's financial records.

This resource aligns with FHIR's [ChargeItem](https://build.fhir.org/chargeitem.html) resource, facilitating interoperability and standardized billing practices.[FHIR Build](https://build.fhir.org/chargeitem.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
