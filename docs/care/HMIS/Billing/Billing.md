# Billing Module

This folder contains documentation for the **Billing** section of the HMIS (Hospital Management Information System) built with FHIR-inspired design principles.

The goal of these documents is to help both **developers** (for integration and validation logic) and **hospital billing staff** (for understanding workflows) navigate and use the billing system effectively.
