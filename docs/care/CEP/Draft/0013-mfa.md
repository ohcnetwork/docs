# CEP-13: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Enhanced Security in CARE

### Motive

Care is being used in various healthcare environments for managing patient information and care delivery. Security is a critical aspect of healthcare applications, especially when dealing with sensitive patient data. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) in CARE will provide an additional layer of security to protect user accounts and patient information from unauthorized access.

## Phased Implementation Plan

To efficiently implement MFA, we will adopt a phased approach:

### **Phase 1: TOTP and Backup Codes**

- **Primary MFA Method:**
  - **TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password):** Using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
- **Backup Options:**
  - **Backup Codes:** One-time use codes provided to users for account recovery.

### **Phase 2: OTP via SMS/Email**

- **Secondary MFA Methods:**
  - **OTP via SMS:** One-time passwords sent to the user's registered mobile number.
  - **OTP via Email:** One-time passwords sent to the user's registered email address.

### **Phase 3: Passkeys**

- **Future Support:**
  - **Passkeys:** Implement passwordless authentication methods using WebAuthn and FIDO2 standards.

## Detailed Requirements

### **Phase 1: TOTP and Backup Codes**

#### **User Flows**

##### **Setup MFA**

- **Initiate Setup:**
  - Users navigate to their account settings and select "Enable MFA."
  - Password verification is required to proceed.
- **TOTP Setup:**
  - The system generates a unique secret key and provisioning URI.
  - Users scan a QR code with their authenticator app or enter the secret key manually.
  - Users confirm setup by entering a TOTP code from the app.
- **Backup Codes:**
  - Users are provided with backup codes to save securely.
- **Notifications:**
  - Users receive email notifications upon successful MFA setup.

##### **Login with MFA**

- **Initial Authentication:**
  - Users enter their username and password.
  - If the user is logging in for the first time after MFA is forced, they are taken to MFA setup.
- **MFA Verification:**
  - If MFA is enabled, users are prompted to enter a code from their authenticator app.
  - Backup codes can be used if the authenticator app is unavailable.
- **Failed Attempts Handling:**
  - After 3 consecutive failed attempts, users receive a warning.
  - After 5 consecutive failed attempts, the account is locked for 15 minutes.
  - Notification or Email are sent to the user and admin regarding the lockout.

##### **Managing MFA Settings** (Applicable to other phases)

- **Accessing MFA Settings:**
  - Users can view their enabled MFA methods in account settings.
- **Disabling MFA:**
  - Password verification is required to disable MFA.
  - Users cannot disable MFA if enforced by admin policies.
- **Notifications:**
  - Users receive email notifications upon changes to MFA settings.

#### **Admin Controls** (Applicable to other phases)

- **Global MFA Enforcement:**
  - Superadmins can enforce MFA for all users across the instance.
  - Configurable via an environment variable or API endpoint.
- **Facility-Level MFA Enforcement:**
  - Facility admins can enforce MFA for all users in their facility.
  - Implement a setting in the `Facility` model to indicate enforcement.
- **User-Level MFA Enforcement:**
  - Users can enable or disable MFA based on the above policies.
  - Users cannot disable MFA if enforced by an admin.

### **Phase 2: OTP via SMS/Email**

#### **User Flows**

##### **Setup MFA**

- **Initiate Setup:**
  - Users select "Enable SMS/Email MFA" in account settings.
  - Password verification is required.
- **Verification:**
  - An OTP is sent via the selected method (SMS or Email).
  - Users confirm setup by entering the OTP.
- **Notifications:**
  - Users receive confirmations upon successful setup.

##### **Login with Secondary MFA**

- **Initial Authentication:**
  - Users enter their username and password.
- **MFA Verification:**
  - Primary MFA is TOTP, users are provided with a link to other MFA options.
  - Users are prompted to enter the OTP received via SMS or Email.
  - Option to resend OTP if not received.
- **Failed Attempts Handling:**
  - Similar to Phase 1, include warnings and account lockouts.

---

### **Phase 3: Passkeys**

#### **User Flows**

##### **Setup Passkeys**

- **Initiate Setup:**
  - Users select "Add Passkeys" in account settings.
  - Device and browser compatibility are checked.
- **Registration:**
  - Users register their device using WebAuthn standards.
  - Cryptographic keys are securely stored.
- **Notifications:**
  - Confirmation upon successful setup.

##### **Login with Passkeys**

- **Passwordless Authentication:**
  - Users are prompted to use their registered device for authentication.
- **Fallback Options:**
  - If passkey authentication fails, fallback to other enabled MFA methods.

## Models

```python
class TOTPDevice(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='totp_device')
    secret_key = models.CharField(max_length=16, unique=True)
    confirmed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

> Need to check which way to go storing each user backup code as each record vs storing all codes in array field. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

```python
class BackupCode(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='backup_codes')
    code = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    is_used = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

Adding an `enforce_mfa` field to the existing `Facility` model enables facility admins to enforce MFA for all users in their facility.

```python
class Facility(models.Model):
  enforce_mfa = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

At instance level we either enforce using ENV key or using a model

```python
class MfaConfiguration(models.Model):

    enforce_mfa = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    max_failed_login_attempts =
    failed_login_lockout_duration =

```

```python
class UserMFASettings(models.Model):

    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='mfa_settings')
    is_mfa_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_totp_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_sms_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_email_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_backup_codes_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    # Timestamp when MFA was enabled
    enabled_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

> Probably we need to run a tasl=k to clean up failed attempts after x days.

```python
class FailedMfaAttempt(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='failed_attempts')
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    # Polymorphic relationship to store the method - TOTP, SMS, Email, PassKey
```
