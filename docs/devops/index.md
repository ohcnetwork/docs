## About

The DevOps section contains standards and procedures for setting up **Care** on multiple cloud platforms, along with tools like OneUptime, which we use for monitoring the health of our deployments. The section also covers the set of CI/CD pipelines, including GitHub Actions, CodeBuild, and CloudBuild, that are used to ensure up-to-date deployments of **Care**.
