# Deploying Care Frontend

## Setting up the Frontend

The development deployment for care relies on ecs for it's backend deployment. The api provided by the backend can be used
by all the development frontends including localhost and the care_fe deploy previews.

We can use any of the following methods to deploy the frontend, for production as well as for deployment previews:

- **Cloudflare Pages**: This is one of the methods for deploying the frontend. It is a static site hosting service that supports automatic deployments from GitHub repositories.
