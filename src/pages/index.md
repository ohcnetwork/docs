# Open Healthcare Network

**Open Healthcare Network (OHC)**, originally established as *Coronasafe Network*, is a pioneering open-source organization dedicated to enhancing healthcare delivery and management. At the core of OHC's innovation is its flagship Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, recognized as the [50th Digital Public Good by the United Nations](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/). This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.

OHC represents a unique fusion of professional expertise and community-driven innovation, primarily fueled by a small team of dedicated developers and a dynamic community of college students. This collaborative model showcases a new paradigm in healthcare technology, emphasizing impactful, sustainable, and scalable solutions.

Originally a volunteer-driven initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, OHC has continually addressed citizen-level healthcare problems. Its CARE software, adopted by several Indian states, played a crucial role in optimizing healthcare resource management during the pandemic. As the pandemic waned, CARE evolved to support the 10BedICU Project, enabling technology-driven ICU care in rural India and providing TeleICU services to the remotest regions, impacting thousands of lives.

Today, beyond the 10BedICU Project, CARE is being adopted for various healthcare applications, including palliative care digitization, demonstrating its adaptability and growing significance in improving healthcare delivery across diverse settings. OHC's journey is a testament to the transformative impact of youth-driven initiatives in healthcare, touching the lives of millions across India.

## Our Mission
Engineering free and open-source tools to maximize human efficiency in compassionate healthcare delivery

## Care 
CARE is a centralized capacity management and patient management system which is a conglomerate of Patients, doctors, hospitals, labs, specialized treatment centres, hospital administrators, shifting control cells etc. Each hospital would have to login and update the information regarding their Assets including bed capacity, health care personnels, current patient count, status etc so that it would be easy for the district administration to get a birds eye view of the entire healthcare system as well as the patients through the smart and intuitive dashboards. 

The journey of the Open Healthcare Network is a testament to the power of community collaboration and open-source development for public good. What began as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into a comprehensive hospital management system operational across 11 Indian states, directly benefiting over 186.8 million people. The system, seamlessly integrated across 581 hospitals, has facilitated medical attention to 362,349 patients and enabled over half a million consultations via 1,884 dedicated health workers.
